    - food crud
    - upload images
    - Summary
        In this episode, we expand the online order app by adding food functionality and integrating image uploads for vendors and food items.
    - Highlights
        🚀 Added food functionality to the vendor profile.
        🥗 Created a food model to associate food items with specific vendors.
        📸 Integrated image upload functionality using Multer.
        🛠️ Updated the vendor controller for food item management.
        🔄 Successfully tested food creation via Postman.
        📁 Implemented cover image upload for vendor profiles.
        ✅ Ensured seamless data handling between MongoDB and the application.
    - Key Insights
        📦 Dynamic Food Management: The integration of food functionality allows vendors to manage their offerings effectively, enhancing user experience. This modular approach benefits scalability as more features can be added later.
        🔗 Vendor-Food Association: Linking food items to specific vendors aids in organizing the menu, making it easier for customers to find what they want, thereby improving order accuracy and satisfaction.
        📈 User Interface Enhancement: The ability to upload images for food items and vendor profiles adds a visual appeal, which can increase customer engagement and trust in the application.
        🔄 Postman Testing: Using Postman for testing ensures that the API endpoints work as intended, allowing developers to catch errors early in the development process.
        🔒 Authentication Considerations: Understanding when to implement authentication is crucial for maintaining security while allowing flexibility in accessing certain functionalities.
        🌐 File Handling Proficiency: Mastering file handling in Node.js (with Multer) opens up possibilities for future features, such as user-uploaded content, enhancing the app’s capabilities.
        📅 Future Development Roadmap: Setting clear next steps for additional features (like shopping and user modules) ensures continuous improvement and keeps the development process organized.
ep4 - Code refactoring & Shopping section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Summary
    In this episode, we refactor the code and implement the shopping section, enabling users to browse food catalogs from vendors based on their location.
- Highlights
    🔍 Refactored code for better organization and maintainability.
    📦 Created separate service files for Express and MongoDB connections.
    🍽️ Implemented routes for the shopping section to access food catalogs.
    📊 Developed a controller to handle food availability queries based on pin codes.
    ⏱️ Added functionality to filter foods available within 30 minutes.
    🏪 Retrieved top restaurants based on user location and availability.
    ✅ Successfully tested API calls using Postman for functionality validation.
- Key Insights
    🔄 Refactoring is crucial for maintaining a clean codebase, improving the project’s scalability. By organizing code into services, we enhance readability and make future updates easier.
    📍 Location-based services play a significant role in food delivery apps, allowing users to find nearby options quickly, thereby improving user experience.
    ⚙️ Implementing controllers for different sections of the application helps manage the complexity, making it easier to handle various functionalities like food availability and restaurant listings.
    ⏲️ The feature to filter food based on preparation time enhances convenience for users, catering to their immediate dining needs.
